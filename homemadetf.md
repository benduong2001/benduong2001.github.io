# Re-inventing Convolutional Neural Networks on Python From Scratch Without Packages.

* During my first year of college as a data science major, I was very intrigued about how neural networks worked, particularly convolutional neural networks - which could algorithmically tell you if a picture is a cat or a dog, for example. 
* There were many youtube tutorial and Medium articles that covered it. But they didn't answer my questions enough, and didn't want to copy and paste Tensorflow code without seeing the math under the hood.
* I had just finished my multi-variable vector calculus and linear algebra classes, which gave me foundation in finally understanding the underlying math of these models
* And so, I spent time deciding to recreate neural networks on Python from scratch, without packages. 
    * Not only did I implement Neural networks by it's own on this project, but I also integrated the support for convolutional ones too. Meaning this project might be able to do image recognition, though basic.
    * This project was also practice to apply principals of data structure design and more computer science -related topics, such as Objected Oriented Programming, Class Inheritance, and the recursion needed for the neural network's backpropagation.
    * Having concluded my matrix math classes, I wanted to test-apply what I just learned, meaning I also coded the Matrix operations in this project from scratch too. ... No NumPy at all!

* With a graphic drawing-canvas interface done with Python Tkinter, I trained and tested the final project's iteration with the basic task of differentiating 1's and 0's, and showed the python implementation worked as intended.

### What did I gain from this?
* Even though this project, in hindsight was an unncessary reinvention of the wheel -with no business usefulness, it was a highly foundational introduction that pushed me into the cold swimming pool of the math of machine learning.
