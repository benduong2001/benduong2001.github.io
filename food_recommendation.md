# Food Recommendation Data Science Project

[(Click here for a more in-depth and ML-technical description of this project!)](/food_recommendation_technical.md)


* This independent data science project of mines, explores food related datasets (unstructured text data) for prediction data analysis tasks involving customer recommendation. Two tasks or "sub-projects" were done:
    * Task 1 is about predicting whether a given user will rate a given restaurant negatively, with their text reviews as input data.
    * Task 2 is about predicting whether a given user likely would visit a given restaurant, using text and images as input data.
       * During the data preparation, I was also able to uncover indirectly-associated sub-groups in the restaurants and customer demographics, based on food, which in itself is a useful and applicable byproduct.

* This project will show:
   * Data Analysis and results applicable to useful business questions on customer recommendation, such as providing insights to user demographic sub-groups.
   * Succinct and Intuitive Data visualizations
