# Food Recommendation Data Science Project

* This Data Science project explores food related datasets for tasks involving customer recommendation:

## Food Rating Prediction given User Text Reviews
* This sentiment analysis prediction will predict whether a user's rating for a restaurant is negative, given the text data of their google review.
* For this task, deep learning, 
* In-depth Feature Engineering will be all that is needed to transform unstructured text data into explainable and structured, tabular data. 


#### **Results and Evaluation**

* Finally, a peek at the 20 strongest coefficients of the prediction model, and their corresponding words.
* In other words, these following words in a google review are the highest associated with a user giving a restaurant a bad rating.

* This makes sense, as most of these words have negative connotations, and even more impressively, it manages to pick out words that aren't just negative "emotional" words (like worst, or bland)- it also includes words that are otherwise arguably neutral but deemed negative *in the context of food at a restaurant* (overpriced, burnt, dry, cold)
* This demonstrates our intricate feature engineering process was successful in extracting meaningfulness from the unstructured text data of the google reviews.
