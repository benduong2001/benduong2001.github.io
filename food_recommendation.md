* This independent data science project of mines, explores food related datasets (unstructured text data) for prediction data analysis tasks involving customer recommendation. Two tasks or "sub-projects" were done:
* This project will show:
   * Data Analysis and results applicable to useful business questions on customer recommendation, such as providing insights to user demographic sub-groups.
   * Succinct and Intuitive Data visualizations

   * Used Tools (Everything is done in Python)
       * Scikit-learn (for TfIdf Vectorizer and Logistic Regression)
       * Matplotlib for visualizations
       * NumPy
       * Tensorflow and Keras

**Sub-Project 1**

* Task 1 is about predicting whether a given user will rate a given restaurant negatively, with their text reviews as input data.

**Sub-Project 2** 

* Task 2 is about predicting whether a given user likely would visit a given restaurant, using text and images as input data.

* Gensim's Word2Vec would be used to be provide vector embeddings for the restaurants and reviewers

* During the data preparation, I was also able to uncover indirectly-associated sub-groups in the restaurants and customer demographics, based on food, which in itself is a useful and applicable byproduct.
