# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

Hello, I am **Benson Duong**. I am a Data Science student at the University of California, San Diego, learning about the fields of data science, programming, analysis, statistics, and machine learning. My projects and work have a recurring interest in social data, looking into business data or map data.

<!--* In my work and projects, I've handled with all aspects of the data science project process for actionable, business impact:
  * Using ETL to retrieve online raw data and transform them to be usable for analysis and modeling
  * Accounting for pit-falls in data such as population bias or imbalanced data
  * Data analysis with plots and/or dashboards that can visually communicate business-minded story-telling
  * Developing predictive ML model and iteratively improving its accuracy metrics
  * Using Python programming to streamline and productionize these steps, making said business impacts easier to find, and more tidy for teammates
-->
* Skills and Tools:
  * I work with the following data tools:
    * **Python**- 5 years of fluency (Pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PySpark, etc.) 
    * **SQL** (PostGreSQL, DuckDB Microsoft SQL Server, Snowflake)
    * **Tableau**, **PowerBI**
    * **Microsoft Excel**
  * Other non data-science related languages or tools that I work with include JavaScript, Java, Git, Docker.

<!--These are some of the projects I've worked on independently or collaborated in. Some are school projects, and due to policy, might sometimes have privated github repo's, but nonetheless I can still provide descriptions of the techniques used.-->
