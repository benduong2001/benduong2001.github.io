# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

Hello, I am **Benson Duong**. I am a Data Science student at the University of California, San Diego, learning about the fields of data science, programming, analysis, statistics, and machine learning. My projects and work have a recurring interest in social data, looking into business data or map data.

* I fluently work with Python for 5 years, using it to perform my data science projects and automate/streamline my day-to-day tasks for efficiency. 
* My frequent python packages include Pandas and NumPy for data transformation/analysis, GeoPandas, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and Tensorflow for Deep Learning- all with 3 year fluency. 
* I also work with SQL, Tableau, and Excel. 
* Other non data-science related languages or tools that I work with include JavaScript, Java, Git Bash, Docker. 
* But I don't stop learning, and for these past several weeks, have been self-learning dbt (data build tool), DuckDB (a DBMS for analytics), and PowerBI.

These are some of my projects. Some are school projects, and due to policy, might sometimes have privated github repo's, but nonetheless I can still provide descriptions of the techniques used.
