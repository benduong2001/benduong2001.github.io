# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

Hello, I am **Benson Duong**. I am a Data Science student at the University of California, San Diego, learning about the fields of data science, programming, analysis, statistics, and machine learning. My projects and work have a recurring interest in social data, looking into business data or map data.

* In my work and projects, I've handled with all aspects of the data science project to result in actionable, business impact:
  * Using ETL techniques to retrieve online raw data and transform them to be usable for analysis and modeling
  * Accounting for pit-falls in data such as population bias or imbalanced data
  * Data analysis with plots and/or dashboards that can visually communicate business-minded story-telling
  * Developing predictive ML model and iteratively improving its accuracy metrics
  * Using Python and programming principles to streamline these steps, making said business impacts easier to find, and more tidy for teammates

* Skills and Tools:
  * I work with **Python** with 5 years of fluency, for my data science projects and to automate/streamline my day-to-day tasks for efficiency. 
    * My frequent python packages include 
        * **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data transformation/analysis
        * **GeoPandas**
        * **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning
        * **Tensorflow** for deep learning.
  * I also work with **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **Excel**. I've also worked with **PySpark** (where you can use SQL within Python).
  * Other non data-science related languages or tools that I work with include JavaScript, Java, Git. Bash, Docker.

These are some of the projects I've worked on indepedently or collaborated in. Some are school projects, and due to policy, might sometimes have privated github repo's, but nonetheless I can still provide descriptions of the techniques used.
