# ArcGIS San Diego Airbnb Project

A DSC170 Class Project with Tyson Tran. It uses ArcGIS's Python API to do data analysis and machine learning on San Diego Airbnb listings.
* Along with numerous, complex data analysis and map visualizations, a linear regression model to predict Airbnb Listing Prices based on the  surrounding geodata was trained, and achieved a near accuracy of 80%.
