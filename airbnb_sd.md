# ArcGIS San Diego Airbnb Project

A DSC170 Class Project with Tyson Tran. It uses ArcGIS's Python API to do data analysis and machine learning on San Diego Airbnb listings. We analyzed the following:
    * Complex Geo-enrichment of zipcode census data including household income, and amount of leisuire businesses established, were all used to develop choropleth maps showing the geospatial relationships it had with the nearby AirBnb Locations by their price (overlaid as a scatterplot), highlighting that those closer to the beach were pricier.
    * Non-Spatial factors in the context of airbnb pricing.
    * Buffering of well-known city landmarks in proximity to these AirBnb's.
    * A linear regression model to predict Airbnb Listing Prices based on the surrounding geodata was trained, and achieved a near accuracy of 80%. Feature Importance bar-plots showed that Accomodation and various geo-enriched factors (such as amount of recreational and leisure businesses within the zipcode) were the most influential.
