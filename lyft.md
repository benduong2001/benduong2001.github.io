# Lyft Motion Prediction Project

![](images/images_lyft/scene112.gif)

I was part of a 4-member team research project spanning 6 months from October 2020 to March 2021, as part of the UCSD Data Science Student Club. 
In this project, my team was given a 20GB dataset tracking the movements and surroundings of Lyft's self-driving vehicle as it navigated the streets of Palo Alto, CA.
