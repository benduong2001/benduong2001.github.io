# DSC102 PySpark Text Classification

* A Pyspark project done by me and Moses Oh for DSC102, a class at UC San Diego covering data engineering

* While we are not permitted to share our code publically, we can describe the techniques we were instructed to do:
    * We were provided with 20GB Text Dataset of Amazon Reviews
    * The endgoal was building a machine learning model on the text reviews and predicting the numerical rating that the Amazon review ended giving to the product (from 1 to 5). This was thus a task of customer satisfaction predicted from text, or *sentiment analysis*.
    * We used NLP Feature Engineering with PySpark's in-built **TF-IDF Vectorizer**, and **Word2Vec**.
    * We also pre-processed the data with Pyspark's in-built **One-hot-encoding**, and **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**.
    * We ran Data-cleaning and data quality tests with **Type-casting** and **Null Imputation**
    * We conducted descriptive statistics tasks and EDA using groupby's and aggregations in PySpark.
    * For the machine learning model, we employed PySpark's **Decision Tree Regressor** and model **pipeline**, and trained the model, which took between around half an hour.
