* This was my final project for USP4, a course at UCSD where we learned how to use ArcGIS, an industry-wide software for geospatial data analysis and science.
* For my proposed subject, I decided to explore the steep topography of San Francisco, and produce maps for the context of its sidewalk pedestrian accessibility for wheelchair users or those that have difficulty walking, such as the elderly.
    * Coverage of vehicular transportation across the city by public transit over steep areas, as an option to bypass physical walking
    * San Francisco Landmarks in steep areas, in terms of walkable accessibility for tourist
